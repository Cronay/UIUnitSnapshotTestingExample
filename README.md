# UIUnitSnapshotTestingExample

This project was accompanied by a presentation in my workplace. 
It shows how we can use Unit and Snapshot Tests to replace common tests done through UI-Tests.
This saves time while running the test suite and enables TDD for components that previously weren't suitable to be test-driven.

You can go through the commits step by step to see how the tests and the production code evolve over the time.
